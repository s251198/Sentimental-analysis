Sentiment analysis: 

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone of a text. It involves identifying the text data to categorize these opinions into positive, negative, and neutral. This is widely used in areas such as customer feedback, social media monitoring, and market research to gauge public sentiment and inform decision- making. This technique helps the organizations and companies respond better to customer needs and improve their product line-up and the user experience.  

Goal: 

My goal is to make a project that uses natural language processing and functional programming to make a sentiment analysis program. We are also going to take is a further and not categorized a text into positive, negative or neutral, but we are going to draw a graph with all the emotions that are there in the text so that the user can get an understanding as to what are the emotions that are there in the text.  

We all know that when a person writes a text there can be mor than just one emotion that is there in the text. For example, one line of the text can be happy and the other can have a sad detail but that is not the sole factor in which the text can be categorized into positive or negative. The program will help you understand the different emotions in the text. 

What have we achieved from this program? 

Sentiment analysis in general categorizes the text into positive, negative, or neutral. But we all know that a big article or text can have many emotions and cannot just consider 2 or 3 sentences and say if a text is positive, negative, or neutral. The programs help understand the different emotions in the text. The other way the program helps us understand which emotion is more dominant than the other is by using a graph system. The system helps a person to view which emotions are more dominant in the text and which are not.  

This thing helps us in many ways. When a person is check any comment on their products then they are going to be looking at the main things that is the positive or negative but when a company wants to enhance the overall user experience of the customer then they are not going to just look for positive or negative but they are also going to look are the individual emotions in order to take more feedback from just one comment.  

What is going on in the code? 

Thew main file that we are going to consider as the main project is the main.py, read.txt and emotions.txt. In the code, first we read a text from the read file and then it will turn all the letters into lowercase and then it will also take out all the punctuation. This helps clean the code a lot and helps us analyze the words individually. What it does next is tokenize the words which means that it splits all the sentences into individual words and then it takes out all the words that dop not have a sentiment or are very general out of the list. This helps in reducing the number of words that the program must review. Then we see that there another text file called the emotions file in this there are the emotions for each of the words that have a sentiment and then what it does is with the help of this file for every word that is there in the list it replaces it with the sentiment and then it counts the number of sentiments that is the most out of them. At the end, to make it easier to understand, it will create a graph that can be viewed in the graph.png file. In this picture we will see that the x axis is the emotions, and the y axis is the number of times it has occurred. 

 

Summary: 

Sentiment analysis is an NLP technique used to determine the emotional tone of text by categorizing opinions as positive, negative, or neutral. Commonly applied in customer feedback, social media monitoring, and market research, it helps organizations respond better to customer needs and improve their products and user experience. The goal of this project is to create a sentiment analysis program that not only categorizes text but also generates a graph displaying the range of emotions present in the text. This approach recognizes that a text can contain multiple emotions, providing a more nuanced understanding than simply positive, negative, or neutral classifications. Traditional sentiment analysis categorizes text broadly, but this program identifies and visualizes the dominant emotions in a text, offering a more detailed analysis. By displaying a graph, users can see which emotions are more prevalent, enhancing their understanding of customer feedback beyond simple sentiment categories. The main files in the project are `main.py`, `read.txt`, and `emotions.txt`. The code reads text from the `read.txt` file, converts it to lowercase, and removes punctuation to clean the text. It then tokenizes the text into individual words and filters out common words without sentiment. Using the `emotions.txt` file, the program matches words to their corresponding emotions, counts the frequency of each emotion, and generates a graph (saved as `graph.png`) showing the emotions on the x-axis and their frequency on the y-axis. This visual representation helps users quickly grasp the emotional landscape of the text.
